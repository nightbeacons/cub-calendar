Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves.

To the delight of the literary set, Rushdie took over the dance floor
at a party for his friend Martin Amis. According to The Times: "Ladies
queued for the spectacle and their jaws dropped in astonishment. The
Rushdie wriggle is an unusual one-legged hop in a crouching position,
arms whirling like a dervish. Appropriate for a man living under the
threat of a fatwa, he was dancing to the strains of "Stayin' Alive" by
the Bee Gees.

Dancing, is, for the most part, attended with many amorous smiles,
wanton compliments, unchaste kisses, scurrilous songs and sonnets,
effeminate music, lust provoking attire, ridiculous love pranks, all
which savor only of sensuality, of raging fleshly lusts.  Therefore, it
is wholly to be abandoned of all good Christians.<p>
Dancing serves no necessary use, no profitable, laudable, or pious end
at all.  It is only from the imbred pravity, vanity, wantonness, 
incontenency, pride, profaneness, or madness of man's depraved nature.
Therefore, it must needs be unlawful unto Christians.

The way to heaven is too steep, too narrow for men to dance in and keep
revel rout.  No way is large or smooth enough for capering rousters, for
jumping, skipping, dancing dames but that broad, beaten, pleasant road
that leads to HELL.  The gate of heaven is too narrow for whole rounds, 
whole troops of dancers to march in together.

The Hokey Pokey (as written by William Shakespeare)

O proud left foot, that ventures quick within
Then soon upon a backward journey lithe.
Anon, once more the gesture, then begin:
Command sinistral pedestal to writhe.
Commence thou then the fervid Hokey-Poke,
A mad gyration, hips in wanton swirl.
To spin! A wilde release from Heavens yoke.
Blessed dervish! Surely canst go, girl.
The Hoke, the poke -- banish now thy doubt
Verily, I say, 'tis what it's all about.
